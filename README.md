# Brief Introduction
The repository is aiming at providing a quick illustration for essential linear algebra concepts. Instead of a detailed presentation, I hope to provide a big picture of linear algebra learned from various sources and help prepare study or interview in advanced subjects such as machine learning algorithms. Any suggestion or communication is welcomed.
